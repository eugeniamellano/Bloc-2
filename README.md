# 1) Speed Dating Analysis Project

## Company's Description ðŸ“‡
Tinder is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests.

Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.

## Project Overview ðŸš§
The goal of this project is to understand what factors contribute to people being interested in each other enough to go on a second date. The dataset used for this analysis comes from a speed dating experiment conducted by Tinder, where participants provided various information about themselves that could reflect on their dating profile. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people and indicates whether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
- Utilize the dataset to gain insights into the factors that influence people's interest in each other.
- Identify key attributes or characteristics.
